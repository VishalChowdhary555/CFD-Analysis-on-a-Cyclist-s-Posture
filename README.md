README: Integrated CFD and EMG Analysis of Cyclist Postures
Project Overview
This study explores the relationship between aerodynamic pressure and muscle activity in the lower back across different cycling positions, focusing on the drop position for its biomechanical benefits. The integration of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Electromyography (EMG) provides a novel approach to posture optimization, offering insights into reducing lower back pain for cyclists.

Key Highlights
Objective: To identify the cycling posture that minimizes lower back strain.
Methodology:
Conducted CFD simulations to assess aerodynamic pressure on the lower back.
Collected real-time EMG data to measure lower back muscle activity.
Correlated CFD pressure data with EMG readings, yielding a strong correlation coefficient of 0.78.
Findings: The drop position demonstrated the least strain on the lower back, with average pressure of 26.139 Pa and EMG activity of 0.325 mV.
Novelty
This project is the first to establish a direct relationship between aerodynamic forces and muscle activity for optimizing cycling posture. The combined CFD-EMG framework offers a comprehensive understanding of biomechanical and aerodynamic effects, enabling informed decisions for posture and performance improvements.

Usage
CFD Analysis:
